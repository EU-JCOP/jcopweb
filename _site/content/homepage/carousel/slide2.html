        JCOP will be deployed and validated through the creation of a Southeast Europe Coordinated Response Cluster
        including the national security authorities of Greece and Cyprus. This will demonstrate the
        capacity- and coordination-building impact of JCOP at the national and the EU level
        (CSIRT Network). In addition, the Norwegian National Security Authority - NSM will contribute to the
        validation of JCOP's applicability. JCOP will be aligned with pertinent EU platforms and initiatives, such as
        the MeliCERTes platform, the Empowering EU ISACs project for information sharing between operators of
        essential services (OES), and the four pilots of the EU Cybersecurity Competence Network.
