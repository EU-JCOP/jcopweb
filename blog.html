              Code Red: A large scale study on ChatGPT generated code vulnerabilities

            <i>
              Recent observations have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs), when employed for code generation, can inadvertently produce vulnerable code. This issue has been highlighted in various small-scale studies, including blog posts and research articles, demonstrating its potential risks. However, the broader implications for software engineering remained unclear, while many developers now rely on AI tools for code generation and auto-completion. Currently, ChatGPT is at the forefront as a leading proprietary technology in LLMs. Understanding the extent to which it is affected by generating vulnerable code, is a crucial question that needs addressing.

              Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) refers to collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about emerging or current cyber threats. It involves gathering and analyzing data from various sources to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities and then using that information to develop strategies for preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber-attacks. <br />The National Cyber Security Authority of Greece deep dives on the importance of cyber threat intelligence.

            <code>Author: UiO</code> <br />
            <i>
              As cyber systems become increasingly complex and cybersecurity threats become more prominent, defenders must prepare, coordinate, automate, document, and share their response methodologies to the extent possible. The CACAO standard was developed to satisfy the above requirements by providing a common machine-readable framework and schema to document cybersecurity operations processes, including defensive tradecraft and tactics, techniques, and procedures. Although this approach is compelling, a remaining limitation is that CACAO provides no native modeling notation for graphically representing playbooks, which is crucial for simplifying their creation, modification, and understanding. In contrast, the industry is familiar with BPMN, a standards-based modeling notation for business processes that has also found its place in representing cybersecurity processes. This research examines BPMN and CACAO and explores the feasibility of using the BPMN modeling notation to graphically represent CACAO security playbooks. The results indicate that mapping CACAO and BPMN is attainable at an abstract level; however, conversion from one encoding to another introduces a degree of complexity due to the multiple ways CACAO constructs can be represented in BPMN and the extensions required in BPMN to fully support CACAO.

Such information includes adversaries' motivations, the countries they have originated from, and the sectors and countries they have targeted. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the new types of contextual information introduced in the enhanced STIX 2.1 representation of the Groups knowledge base to filter adversaries of interest.

              Since digital technologies become more pervasive in everyday lives
              and economies, cybersecurity incidents are getting frequent and
              diversified. Data breaches exposed 4.1 billion records in the
              first half of 2019, while the recently-released ENISA Threat
              Landscape for 2020 reports an increase in sophisticated and
              targeted ransomware exploits in the public sector, health care
              organisations and other industries, as well as the increased
              prevalence of hybrid threats, combing both the cyber and physical
              domains.
              <br />
              In this regard, ENISA's policy conclusions and recommendations

              strategic and political decisions that will effectively tackle
              threats that threaten the well-being of the European Union. It is
              also emphasized that cooperation and coordination of EU-wide CTI
              activities are essential for informing and driving emergency
              decisions needed in crisis management...
