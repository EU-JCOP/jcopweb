                <h3>SPHYNX Cyber Range in Action: The JCOP's Training Sessions</h3>
                <p>
                    For the JCOP project, the SPHYNX Cyber Range platform was leveraged to deliver essential training sessions. SPHYNX developed additional content to enhance cybersecurity capabilities and delivered two separate training sessions: the first focused on Incident Response, while the second addressed GDPR-related topics.

                <p>
                    These training sessions were part of the 2nd JCOP Capacity Building Workshop, organized in conjunction with the last JCOP Plenary Meeting in Athens on May 24, 2024. The event was a significant success, held both online and on-site at the Ministry of Digital Governance's facilities. It featured participants from the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the National Cyber Security Authority (NCSA) of Greece, and the Digital Security Authority (DSA) of Cyprus.

                    Delivered Training Programmes
                </h3>
                <p>Below is a description of each training programme delivered through the SPHYNX Cyber Range platform during the 2nd JCOP Capacity Building Workshop:</p>
                <h4>Incident Response Training Programme</h>
                <p>The "Linux Tools in Incident Handling" programme empowers trainees with advanced skills in forensic analysis and attack trace discovery. Through a blend of theoretical instruction and practical exercises, participants learn to automate complex incident response tasks. The comprehensive hands-on assessment involves analyzing netflow logs to identify IP addresses, trace their origins, and extract critical attack information, ensuring a thorough understanding of cyber forensic techniques.</p>
                <h4>GDPR Training Programme</h4>
                <p>The GDPR training programme consists of two scenarios: “Introduction to GDPR” and “International Data Transfers.” The first scenario introduces the basic concepts of GDPR, its purposes, and applicability. The second scenario equips trainees with knowledge on cross-border data flows, covering topics like adequacy decisions, standard contractual clauses, and internal policies.
