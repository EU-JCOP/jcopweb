          The project aims to design, develop and deliver a Joint Cybersecurity Operations Platform (JCOP) tailored to the needs of EU Member State authorities entrusted with cybersecurity, providing a holistic cybersecurity operations solution, which includes: (i) Cyber ​​Threat Intelligence; (ii) Incident Response, and; (iii) Cybersecurity Operations Training Capability. JCOP will facilitate the shared situational awareness, preparedness, and coordinated incident response with the cybersecurity structures and mechanisms established under the Directive on network security and information systems (NIS Directive).

          JCOP will be deployed and validated through the creation of a Southeast Europe Coordinated Response Cluster including the national security authorities of Greece (Ministry of Digital Governance, National Cyber ​​Security Authority - NCSA) and Cyprus (Cypriot Digital Security Authority - DSA). This will demonstrate the capacity- and coordination-building impact of JCOP at the national (national JCOP instances) and the EU level (national JCOP along with EU cybersecurity bodies, CSIRT Network, CERT-EU, and ENISA). JCOP will be a prototypical implementation of the EC Recommendation on Coordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises and a model that can be applied to all EU Member States. In addition to the Southeast Europe Coordinated Response Cluster, the Norwegian National Security Authority - NSM will contribute to the validation of JCOP's applicability. JCOP will be aligned with pertinent EU platforms and initiatives, such as the MeliCERTes platform, the Empowering EU ISACs project for information sharing between operators of essential services (OES), and the four pilots of the EU Cybersecurity Competence Network.
