          The project aims to design, develop and deliver a Joint Cybersecurity Operations Platform (JCOP) tailored to
          the needs of EU Member State authorities entrusted with cybersecurity, providing a holistic cybersecurity
          operations solution, which includes: (i) Cyber ​​Threat Intelligence; (ii) Incident Response, and; (iii)
          Cybersecurity Operations Training Capability. JCOP will facilitate the shared situational awareness,
          preparedness, and coordinated incident response with the cybersecurity structures and mechanisms established
          under the Directive on network security and information systems (NIS Directive).

          JCOP will be deployed and validated through the creation of a Southeast Europe Coordinated Response Cluster
          including the national security authorities of Greece (Ministry of Digital Governance, National Cyber
          ​​Security Authority - NCSA) and Cyprus (Cypriot Digital Security Authority - DSA). This will demonstrate the
          capacity- and coordination-building impact of JCOP at the national (national JCOP instances) and the EU level
          (national JCOP along with EU cybersecurity bodies, CSIRT Network, CERT-EU, and ENISA). JCOP will be a
          prototypical implementation of the EC Recommendation on Coordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity
          Incidents and Crises and a model that can be applied to all EU Member States. In addition to the Southeast
          Europe Coordinated Response Cluster, the Norwegian National Security Authority - NSM will contribute to the
          validation of JCOP's applicability. JCOP will be aligned with pertinent EU platforms and initiatives, such as
          the MeliCERTes platform, the Empowering EU ISACs project for information sharing between operators of
          essential services (OES), and the four pilots of the EU Cybersecurity Competence Network.
